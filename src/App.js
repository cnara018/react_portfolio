                        to deepen my understanding of web development. Here, I sharpened my skills in programming and was introduced to HTML, JavaScript, CSS, react.js, and MySQL. Back in late 2019, I graduated from Florida 
                        International University with my Bachelors of Science in Information Technology. In pursuit of my Bachelors degree in Information Technology, I took a lot of different courses involving major computer concepts such Programming, Database Administration, Networking, Cyber Security, and 
                        was exposed to the many opportunities the technology industry has to offer. I really enjoyed programming and the vast oppurtunities that it presented, thus, decided this was the path I wanted to pursue.</p>
